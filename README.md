# AutoMods_Reddit
Auto Moderator to post a "Request For Feedback" Post.

/r/podcasts is becoming a bit of an eye-sore in terms of readability. 


### REASONS
1. No way to identify what the post is about at a glance  
2. No grouping of like posts
3. Not enough pre-written stuff we can point people to

### TOOLS
There are four tools available to solve these issues

1. Tagging
2. Flair
3. AutoModerators post thingies.
4. The Wiki

### FIXES

####  Title and Flair Suggestions: I wrote a post here explaining how totally awesome this idea as a comment: [Tagging/Flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/34lovs/should_we_stop_allowing_feedback_please_posts_in/cqwja16)
- OPML: Listening recommendations
- Feedback: Request for feedback  
*NOTE: I am interested in and enjoy giving feedback; alas, there are issues: finding requests for feedback, saving requests so I can return to them later, then finding requests again so I can post feedback is PITA!*
- FreeAdvice: Unsolicited advice
- News: News related to podcasting
- Looking4Listeners: Just what the title says. Probably too long, but there is an obvious need for this flair/tag/title thingy.
- How-to: How to do stuff.
- Equipment
- Discussion/Idea
